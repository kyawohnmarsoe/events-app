Hi,

When I saw project description in pdf ... 
I was thinking ... it should be like an shopping cart ...
Because ...
We need to display products (here in our project are events) ... 
User can add or remove events to the cart (list) ...
So, I created it like shopping cart process ...

# #####################

1. First I find react template from material-UI as you mention in pdf ... 
2. Then fetch data from the mock API ... (It will show circular progress while loading or will show error message if API fetching fail)
3. When user clicked "Add to enteries" button ... information of that clicked event will be recorded in enteries list ... and at the right cornor of nav-bar you will see badge with label, how many events you have added.
4. You can also remove events from the entereis list.
5. Finally you can go and check the enteries list by clicking on icon badge.
6. Events are displayed paginated, 10 events per page. (First I thought to set only 9 per page because our design has 3 columns in each row ... but Here numbers columns will change according to the screen size. so, it will not be a problem ... I have seen that kind in other websites as well )
7. I have no idea for the "App Name" so I just gave it as "Events App" ...
but in naming the variable we can not named as 'event' ... so I replaced with 'card' it just a default name from material UI ... 

OK, That's all ...
Have a nice day!
